        What is Carbon Footprint?\n\n
        Carbon footprint is the impact of human activities measured
        in terms of the area of biologically productive land and water
        required to produce the goods consumed and to assimilate the
        carbon wastes generated. Carbon wastes, in other words, Greenhouse gases are
        measured in CO2e. They directly contribute to climate change.\n\n
        There are many different CO2e contributors, such as
        cars, and heating systems in buildings. But did you know, that food is
        also a source of CO2e? Our GreenFoodChallenge app measures how much CO2e
        your diet produces and helps discover how much you can save by making
        dietary adjustments! Find out what you can do to save Earth!
